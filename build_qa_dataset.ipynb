    "This is related to ultraviolet catastrophe topic. The ultraviolet catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium would emit an unbounded quantity of energy as wavelength decreased into the ultraviolet range.[1]: 6–7 The term 'ultraviolet catastrophe' was first used in 1911 by Paul Ehrenfest,[2] but the concept originated with the 1900 statistical derivation of the Rayleigh–Jeans law.\"\"\"},\n",
